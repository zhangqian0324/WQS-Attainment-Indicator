# Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Standards Attainment Indicator
This R Shiny APP is designed for visualizing the water quality standards attainment for the tidal segments of Chesapeake Bay.

Notes:
1. Attainment indicator: 1 = full attainment; 0 = not in full attainment.
2. Designated use: OW = open water dissolved oxygen (DO); DW = deep water DO; DC = deep channel DO; MSN = migratory spawning and nursery DO; CHLA = chlorophyll-a; SWBG = shallow water bay grasses / water clarity.
3. Assessment period: Year represents the first year of a 3-year assessment period, e.g., year 1985 represents the 1985-1987 period; year 2018 represents the 2018-2020 period.
